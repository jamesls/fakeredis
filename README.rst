fakeredis is a pure-Python implementation of the redis-py python client
that simulates talking to a redis server.  This was created for a single
purpose: **to write unittests**.  Setting up redis is not hard, but
many times you want to write unittests that do not talk to an external server
(such as redis).  This module now allows tests to simply use this
module as a reasonable substitute for redis.

Although fakeredis is pure Python, you will need lupa_ if you want to run Lua
scripts. If you install fakeredis with ``pip install fakeredis[lua]`` it will
be automatically installed.

.. _lupa: https://pypi.org/project/lupa/

Alternatives
============

Consider using birdisle_ instead of fakeredis. It embeds the redis codebase
into a Python extension, so it implements the full redis command set and
behaves far more closely to a real redis implementation. The disadvantage is
that it currently only works on Linux.

How to Use
==========

The intent is for fakeredis to act as though you're talking to a real
redis server.  It does this by storing state internally.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import fakeredis
  >>> r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis()
  >>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
  True
  >>> r.get('foo')
  'bar'
  >>> r.lpush('bar', 1)
  1
  >>> r.lpush('bar', 2)
  2
  >>> r.lrange('bar', 0, -1)
  [2, 1]

The state is stored in an instance of `FakeServer`. If one is not provided at
construction, a new instance is automatically created for you, but you can
explicitly create one to share state:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import fakeredis
  >>> server = fakeredis.FakeServer()
  >>> r1 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
  >>> r1.set('foo', 'bar')
  True
  >>> r2 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
  >>> r2.get('foo')
  'bar'
  >>> r2.set('bar', 'baz')
  True
  >>> r1.get('bar')
  'baz'
  >>> r2.get('bar')
  'baz'

It is also possible to mock connection errors so you can effectively test
your error handling. Simply set the connected attribute of the server to
`False` after initialization.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import fakeredis
  >>> server = fakeredis.FakeServer()
  >>> server.connected = False
  >>> r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
  >>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
  ConnectionError: FakeRedis is emulating a connection error.
  >>> server.connected = True
  >>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
  True

Fakeredis implements the same interface as `redis-py`_, the
popular redis client for python, and models the responses
of redis 5.0.

Porting to fakeredis 1.0
========================

Version 1.0 is an almost total rewrite, intended to support redis-py 3.x and
improve the Lua scripting emulation. It has a few backwards incompatibilities
that may require changes to your code:

1. By default, each FakeRedis or FakeStrictRedis instance contains its own
   state. This is equivalent to the `singleton=True` option to previous
   versions of fakeredis. This change was made to improve isolation between
   tests. If you need to share state between instances, create a FakeServer,
   as described above.

2. FakeRedis is now a subclass of FakeStrictRedis, and similarly
   FakeStrictRedis is a subclass of StrictRedis. Code that uses `isinstance`
   may behave differently.

3. The `connected` attribute is now a property of `FakeServer`, rather than
   `FakeRedis` or `FakeStrictRedis`. You can still pass the property to the
   constructor of the latter (provided no server is provided).

Other limitations
=================

Apart from unimplemented commands, there are a number of cases where fakeredis
won't give identical results to real redis. The following are differences that
are unlikely to ever be fixed; there are also differences that are fixable
(such as commands that do not support all features) which should be filed as
bugs in Github.

1. Hyperloglogs are implemented using sets underneath. This means that the
   `type` command will return the wrong answer, you can't use `get` to retrieve
   the encoded value, counts will be slightly different (they will in fact be
   exact).

2. When a command has multiple error conditions, such as operating on a key of
   the wrong type and an integer argument is not well-formed, the choice of
   error to redis may not match redis.

3. The `incrbyfloat` and `hincrbyfloat` commands in redis use the C `long
   double` type, which typically has more precision than Python's `float`
   type.

4. Redis makes guarantees about the order in which clients blocked on blocking
   commands are woken up. Fakeredis does not honour these guarantees.

5. Where redis contains bugs, fakeredis generally does not try to provide exact
   bug-compatibility. It's not practical for fakeredis to try to match the set
   of bugs in your specific version of redis.

6. There are a number of cases where the behaviour of redis is undefined, such
   as the order of elements returned by set and hash commands. Fakeredis will
   generally not produce the same results, and in Python versions before 3.6
   may produce different results each time the process is re-run.

7. SCAN/ZSCAN/HSCAN/SSCAN will not necessary iterate all items if items are
   deleted during iteration. They also won't necessarily iterate in the same
   chunk sizes or the same order as redis.


Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome.  Please see the `contributing guide`_ for
more details. The maintainer generally has very little time to work on
fakeredis, so the best way to get a bug fixed is to contribute a pull
request.

If you'd like to help out, you can start with any of the issues
labeled with `HelpWanted`_.


Running the Tests
=================

To ensure parity with the real redis, there are a set of integration tests
that mirror the unittests.  For every unittest that is written, the same
test is run against a real redis instance using a real redis-py client
instance.  In order to run these tests you must have a redis server running
on localhost, port 6379 (the default settings).  The integration tests use
db=10 in order to minimize collisions with an existing redis instance.


To run all the tests, install the requirements file::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you just want to run the unittests::

    nosetests test_fakeredis.py:TestFakeStrictRedis test_fakeredis.py:TestFakeRedis

Because this module is attempting to provide the same interface as `redis-py`_,
the python bindings to redis, a reasonable way to test this to to take each
unittest and run it against a real redis server.  fakeredis and the real redis
server should give the same result.  This ensures parity between the two.  You
can run these "integration" tests like this::

    nosetests test_fakeredis.py:TestRealStrictRedis test_fakeredis.py:TestRealRedis test_fakeredis_hypothesis.py

In terms of implementation, ``TestRealRedis`` is a subclass of
``TestFakeRedis`` that overrides a factory method to create
an instance of ``redis.Redis`` (an actual python client for redis)
instead of ``fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis``.

To run both the unittests and the "integration" tests, run::

    nosetests

If redis is not running and you try to run tests against a real redis server,
these tests will have a result of 'S' for skipped.

There are some tests that test redis blocking operations that are somewhat
slow.  If you want to skip these tests during day to day development,
they have all been tagged as 'slow' so you can skip them by running::

    nosetests -a '!slow' test_fakeredis.py
